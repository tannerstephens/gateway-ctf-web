Remember to always use a modern browser, like Chrome or Firefox so you can 'Inspect Elements'.
The 'Elements' tab shows the html elements, so you don't need to look through a ton of code to find the specific element you are looking for.
The 'Console' tab is a Javascript interpreter. This allows you to call JS functions, variables and other cool frontend stuff.
The 'Sources' tab shows all the files included in the application, images, css files, javascript files, etc. All organized by their location.
The 'Network' tab shows requests made from the client. This includes ajax requests and external resources, shown in the sources tab, that are loaded by the page.
The 'Application' tab allows you to view and edit Local Storage, Session variables, Cookies, and a ton more.
